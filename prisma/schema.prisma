// Some databases, such as MongoDB or PlanetScale, do not support foreign keys. Additionally, in some cases developers may prefer not to use foreign keys in their relational database that usually does support foreign keys. For these situations, Prisma offers the prisma relation mode, which emulates some properties of relations in relational databases. When you use Prisma Client with the prisma relation mode enabled, the behavior of queries is identical or similar, but referential actions and some constraints are handled by the Prisma engine rather than in the database.

// There are performance implications to emulation of referential integrity and referential actions in Prisma Client. In cases where the underlying database supports foreign keys, it is usually the preferred choice

  // The prisma relation mode does not use foreign keys, so no indexes are created when you use Prisma Migrate or db push to apply changes to your database. You instead need to manually add an index on your relation scalar fields with the @@index attribute (or the @unique, @@unique or @@id attributes, if applicable).
